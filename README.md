# Nicotine-Auto-File-Search

The goal if this repo is to automate downloading high quality music files.  
The input is a text file that contains a list of songs with authors.  
The output is a directory of high quality music files.  

The script uses the soulseek network. I will let wikipedia explain what this is:
```
Soulseek is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing network and application. T
he term Soulseek might refer to (1) one of the two networks, or (2) one of the three official user client interfaces. 
Soulseek is used mostly to exchange music, although users are able to share a variety of files.
```

The script is a plugin for the most used soulseek client [nicotine+](https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus)
